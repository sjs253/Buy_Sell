1. Automated the generation of model,controller,views by
        rails generate scaffold commodity item_name:string item_description:text price:integer
2. Route for the "root" page is added as 
        root "commodities#index"
    this renders the index page of our app
3. Added the gem "devise" for adding the authentication part.
        rails generate devise:install   -> this this makes two files for devise namely devise.rb and devise.en.yml
4.      rails generate devise User  -> this creates a migration file,model,alobg with the respective routes.
5. The file app/views/layouts/application.html.erb is edited
        There is an if,else statement which helps us to display the links to logout,login etc
6. Now we associate each todo list with it's user id
        rails generate migration add_column_user_id_to_app user_id:integer
   this adds a column to my database
   Now whenever new complaint is filed... it is being linked with the user by
        @complaint_management.user_id = current_user.id
   Also for showing all the complaints of a user on the index page we use
        @complaint_management= ComplaintManagement.where(:user_id => current_user.id)
7.Also in the controller section we have to handle
        A user can have many complaints
        and a particular complaint belongs to a user
        also we add code so that it validates the presence of the user (basically user login)
